        <h2>Animation Inspiration</h2>
        <div class="inspiration">
          <a href="#">
            <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Stephanie Berning">
            <p>This website inspired me because of how unique the animations were with showing off the different types of chocolate.  When a chocolate is selected, there is a really cool animation that allows you to see a piece of chocolate broken off from the bar.  It is a subtle but interactive animation.  Feels very natural with the chocolate and the website. </p>

            <p>This is a beautiful website with 3D visuals of what the navigation tabs represent.  The animations make the website almost impossible to use; it makes the site crash and very slow.  They are beautiful and mix modern with the Victorian era marble statues. “The-Artery is a full-service creative studio that specializes in creating content for features films, episodic, and consumer brands across all platforms.” </p>

            <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Stephanie Berning">
            <p>The slider effect is fun to play with and very visually stimulating.  It is a very creative way to show off their many options of ice cream flavors.  When a flavor is selected, animation shows the whole ice cream and various information about the flavor. It is simplistic and straight to the point.</p>
